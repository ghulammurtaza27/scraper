We are routinely getting on with our day and suddenly out of nowhere, a gush of wind comes our way bringing with it a whirlwind, a ghost of sorts, of memories past. It immediately feels like we are under-attack. We feel the urge to wield our weapons against it, all the stories and justifications we built in our head to fight it off are worn right away like an armor, and a state of fight is assumed because we are afraid. Afraid that it is going to destroy us(again) if we just sit back and let it take control."

And trust our soul take charge and create harmony between the breeze that we find ourselves in the middle of and our eventual destination. Even when it may feel like the soul hasn’t taken charge. We must have faith that it has."

      "type": "p",
      "text": "And we don’t need an audience for this ritual. We are the audience. Sometimes, that is our sole role in our own life. That of a silent, accepting, observer. We could fight our inability to direct the course and create havoc, all the while creating a false sense of vulnerability by involving others. OR, we could just let the breeze pass and just be present for it and patient with it, without projecting our consciousness onto the course of events. It would be a futile effort to insert ourselves in the midst, one that is inconsistent with our soul. As they say in Punjabi,"

By ceasing control, we coexisted with our past. And that’s all we can do. We cannot undo it. We can only learn to live with it. And it is equally important to realize that this is not a coping mechanism but the only sustainable way of dealing with past. So, the next time, when it comes knocking, we do not have to get shaken by it, forced to relinquish all control when we can’t fight it off and consequently, left to feel helpless and in a state of doubt. Instead, we can know exactly what to do and have the perspective that when it passes which it shall, we will still have ourselves to go back to."
